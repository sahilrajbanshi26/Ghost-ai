Add real-time room chat to the AI sidebar using a separate Liveblocks `ai-chat` feed.

This is only for chat messages. Keep it separate from `ai-status-feed`, which handles AI progress and presence updates.

## Implementation

1. Add the `ai-chat` feed.
   
   Before implementing, check the existing Liveblocks setup and follow the same feed patterns already used in the project.
   - create or reuse a Liveblocks feed named `ai-chat`
   - keep it room-scoped
   - do not mix it with `ai-status-feed`

2. Wire the chat feed into the sidebar.
   - subscribe to `ai-chat` in the sidebar chat area
   - render chat messages in order
   - show sender, timestamp, and message content
   - keep the styling consistent with the existing sidebar UI
   - use Tailwind utilities and existing shadcn components where they fit

3. Add message sending.
   - allow users in the room to send messages to `ai-chat`
   - use the existing sidebar input and send button
   - clear the input after a successful send
   - show a small error state if sending fails

4. Add message validation.
   - define or reuse a Zod schema in `types/tasks.ts`
   - message shape should include sender, role, content, and timestamp
   - validate feed messages before rendering them
